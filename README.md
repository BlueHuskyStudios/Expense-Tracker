Expense-Tracker
===============

A modification the Tip Calculator app to turn it into one that keeps track a person's expenses.

The app should be used by a person that gets a fixed salary each month. The person has a certain amount of debt that e wants to payoff eventually. Your app should ask the user for the following: (@2 points each)
	- Monthly salary
	- Percentage of the salary to be used for debt payoff (may use a slider here)
	- Monthly dollar amount to be used for bills
	- Monthly dollar amount to be used for food
	- Monthly dollar amount to be used for mortgage and/or rent
	- Monthly dollar amount to be used for transportation
	- Monthly dollar amount to be used for extras

(2 points) The app would then show the dollar amount saved each month, (2 points) the amount of time it takes for the person to pay off er debts, and (2 points) the amount of money saved once debt is payed off.

Be creative. Use the Layout of your choice. Feel free to include images in your GUI.
